Per se this world is about doing what you love but for some they don't get the opportunity. I have always loved to be behind a computer doing something valuable besides playing video games, social media and shopping. Watching movies when a hacker decodes the impossible was very fascinating, i love to think and challenge myself. I love to create something from scratch so this was the best career platform for me- software development! I want to travel the world documenting life besides normal life, and so with a 9-5 job thats impossible because you only have vacation time, yet i want all my time lol. With software development, you can work remotely. Remote work as i travel fulltime- thats my dream!
